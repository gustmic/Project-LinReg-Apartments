# Apartment Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using supervised learning techniques to predict apartment prices in Midsommarkransen, Stockholm, Sweden for 2024.

## Data
The initial dataset includes various features such as Adress, Price, Living Area, Monthly Fee, and Year of Building and the data was collected from the Swedish Real Estate site www.booli.se(https://www.booli.se).

## Methodology
We employed linear regression to predict prices, utilizing transformations, scaling and tuning of models to enhance model performance.

## Results
The final model achieved an R² score of 0.92 (based on test set), indicating strong predictive capability. On previously unseen data, the R² score was 0.87.

## Usage
To run the code, clone this repository and ensure you have the required libraries installed. Execute the main script to train the model and make predictions.
